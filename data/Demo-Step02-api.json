More than 90% of the heat trapped by humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions has been absorbed by the seas. The vast amount of energy being added to the oceans drives sea-level rise and enables hurricanes and typhoons to become more intense. The research has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences."
